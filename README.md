```

### How do i use this?

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import tw from 'tailwind.macro';
import styled from '@emotion/styled';

// like this 
const Container = styled.div`
  ${tw`py-8`};
`
// or this
const Text = styled.p(tw`bg-black text-white`);

const Home: FC = () => (
  <Container>
    <Text>
    I am Text component made with Tailwind CSS + EmotionJS + Typescript
    </Text>
  </Container>
)

export default Home
```

### Why would I use it?

Becuase you would like to use Tailwind CSS with Typescript & JS-IN-CSS. You know how awesome it utility first CSS. 

Compared to CSS framework like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) gives you alot of class as utilities. The file size gets bloated. In fact it's 1.5 times bigger than Bootstrap. (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size )

CSS-in-JS to save.

Fortunately, you can use CSS-in-JS like [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion), to only load needed styles. So you can keep you css size small.

Furthremore, CSS-in-JS is just awesome. [CSS in JS: Benefits, Drawbacks, and Tooling](https://objectpartners.com/2017/11/03/css-in-js-benefits-drawbacks-and-tooling/)

Why Gatsby?
Because Gatsby is blazing fast, and comes with alot of plugins
